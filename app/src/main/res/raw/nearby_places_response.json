Kokkari had a pork chop special the other night roasting over the fire and it was melt in your mouth kind of good. Might’ve been the best pork I’ve ever had since there was a lot of love and care put into this cut of meat. Wine selection was vast and detailed. The waiter helped me pick a popular Greek red wine. Dessert was phenomenal and I can’t even remember the name of it. I’ve always wanted to try this dessert and the plate they bring out is picture perfect, had to get it!

This has gone down as one of the best birthday lunches I’ve ever had. I started off with the savory oyster shooter, which was very tasty and satisfying. Although I typically get sweet and/or fruity drinks, this savory drink showed my tastebuds a great time. The 6 oysters that I ordered were truly phenomenal. Each one had a unique and refreshing taste. To no one’s surprise, I devoured the oysters. Finally, the rustic seafood stew was THE perfect dish. Out of all the seafood stews I have tried, this one tops them all. It was bursting with flavor and I couldn’t get enough. It was very fresh, high quality, and perfect in every way. This restaurant goes down as one of my top favorites for seafood, specifically oysters. I absolutely, most definitely, highly recommend.",

The Vegetarian spread is limited but they are open to tweak dishes for you. I could see a number of people enjoying the Kebabs. Loved the Old Fashioned Cocktail and the service was just superb. Kamal knew the menu and could explain the dishes well and helped us select. A little expensive but in line with the premium location. Worth the experience .",

Among the 9 dishes, we like dumplings, sesame balls, and bean curd roll a lot. Sesame balls are a little expensive at $15, but they are the best I have had so far (I like dessert a lot). The place is comfy, the dim sum carts are all around you. The jasmine tea uses true high quality tea leaves that is one of the best in Chinese restaurants I have been to. This place has been on the Michelin list twice (2016 and 2021). They deserve it.",

When I went there a few months ago, there were no push carts and I was disappointed. However, it was back this time.\n\nWe ordered all the vegetable dimsum and we liked them all. The savory vegetable was our favorite. The sesame balls are always the best way to finish the meal. Their fresh brewed tea at the table in a beautiful teapot (herbal tea) is another thing we all had and loved",

It was one of the only places open after 10 p.m., and there was a happy hour from 10-11 p.m., which was a pleasant surprise.\n\nThe decor was quite stunning and modern, and the place had great vibes even at that late hour. It was exactly the kind of late-night find we were hoping for.\n\nWe got seated right away, and the staff was attentive and helpful. They walked us through the menu, explained the happy hour, and made great suggestions on menu options.\n\nWe started with a Not Your Daddy’s Old Fashioned and the Fade to Blackberry—both highly recommended. Since it was late, we kept it simple and had the tater tots, crab cake, and skirt steak. Everything was cooked perfectly and absolutely delicious.\n\nOverall, I highly recommend STK, especially if you’re looking for a late-night dinner.",
